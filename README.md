# CMB_Polarization_Experiments
Currently, CMB Polarization measurement are the most promising way to explore understand the primordial universe and inflation epoch. CMB is a thermal radiation with a mean temperature of 2.73K, and their anisotropies are in order of nK. We intended to use cryogenic BLIP detectors to achieve the required sensitivity. CMB polarization experiments not only require the measurement of power, we must measure the polarization of the CMB taking into account foregrounds and systematic effects caused by the imaging system. This repository intended to understand main components of a detection systems based on a  sub-mm interferometer, equiped with a flocal plane of BLIP detectors read out using Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) or Code Division Multiplexing (CDM). These kind of detectors could be MKIDs o or TES using a Microwave SQUID Multiplexer.
